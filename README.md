Creating Wordle game interface and bot with Cooper Smith

Notes for improvement/further study:

- Create graphical interface with buttons and instructions pop-up
- Solver currently does not rule out words with letter in the same location as a yellow-marked character.
- Easy hack to make solver guess rate better is to start with specific words with many vowels (adios)
- When game is over, last character can still be changed by typing on the keyboard.
- Could disallow guesses that aren't real words
